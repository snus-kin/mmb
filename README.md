# Make My Blog
`mmb` is a simple static site generator with lots of extensibility and simple
templating. 

## TODO
- [ ] Feeds support with atom
- [x] Generate template blog posts with subcommand
- [x] More command line options ESPECIALLY output directory
- [ ] More theming
- [ ] Categories (?)
- [ ] Import / Export options
  - [ ] `feeds.nim` has function for dumping json, perhaps this could be a stream for stdout
- [ ] Convert blogUrl config entry to canonical URL
